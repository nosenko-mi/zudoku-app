User provides voice input.\n2. The app processes audio locally and/or sends it to the backend for further processing.\n3. Returns pronunciation accuracy and feedback.\n\n## External API Integrations\nFirebase Authentication: Secure login and user identity management.\nPush Notifications (if implemented): Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for engagement reminders."],"names":[],"mappings":"uyBAAE,SAAA;qCAEC,SAAA;aAEH,SAAA;aAEA,SAAA;aAEA,SAAA;;cAEE,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;;yCAEC,SAAA;aAEH,SAAA;aAEA,SAAA;aAEA,SAAA;;cAEE,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;;sCAEC,SAAA;aAEH,SAAA;aAEA,SAAA;;cAEE,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;;aAEF,SAAA;+CAEG,SAAA;aAEH,SAAA;aAEA,SAAA;;cAEG,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;;6CAEA,SAAA;aACH,SAAA;AAAA"}
