NLP-based quiz generation is preferred for lower-cost processing.\n\nFirebase services will be used for authentication and notifications, requiring adherence to Google’s platform policies.\n\nBandwidth limitations must be considered, ensuring efficient data transmission for low-connectivity environments.\n\n## Security & Compliance\n\nUser authentication must use Firebase Authentication, ensuring secure login and data protection.\n\nAll stored user data must comply with GDPR and other relevant data privacy regulations.\n\nThe app must enforce HTTPS encryption for all API communications.\n\n## Reliability & Performance Constraints\n\nThe app must function without requiring an always-on internet connection, except for quiz fetching and cloud-based voice recognition.\n\nThe server should handle at least 500 quiz requests per minute without degrading performance.\n\nThe system should ensure at least 99% uptime, requiring robust cloud infrastructure.\n\n## Third-Party Service Dependencies\n\nDependency on Firebase means the app must be adaptable to any changes in Google’s policies or pricing.\n\nAny external APIs used for text processing (e.g., OpenAI for LLM-based quizzes) must be considered for cost and availability constraints.\n"],"names":[],"mappings":"s6BAAE,SAAA;gDAEC,SAAA;aAEH,SAAA;aAEA,SAAA;AAAA;mDAGG,SAAA;aAEH,SAAA;aAEA,SAAA;aAEA,SAAA;wCAEG,SAAA;aAEH,SAAA;aAEA,SAAA;aAEA,SAAA;wCAEG,SAAA;aAEH,SAAA;aAEA,SAAA;aAEA,SAAA;wDAEG,SAAA;aAEH,SAAA;aAEA,SAAA;aAEA,SAAA;oDAEG,SAAA;aAEH,SAAA;aAEA,SAAA"}
