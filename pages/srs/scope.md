# Scope of this Document

This document describes the features, limitations, and technical details of the LexiLoop application. The app focuses on improving English learning by dynamically generating quizzes from books. Depending on the quiz type, NLP or LLM techniques are used to ensure effective and cost-efficient content generation. The application is designed with a mobile-first approach using Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) and will support Android and PC, with potential future extensions to iOS. A backend server, developed using FastAPI, will handle quiz generation and voice recognition features.

The document also provides an estimate of development time and cost. Since LLMs can be expensive, a hybrid approach using NLP for simpler quizzes helps optimize resources. The anticipated development effort includes:

* Mobile application development using KMP, Jetpack Compose, and Room for data storage.

* Backend development with Python, FastAPI, and NLTK for language processing.

* Integration of Firebase for authentication and notifications.

* Voice recognition implementation using pre-trained PyTorch models.

This specification will assist in project planning, reducing risks, and ensuring the delivery of a high-quality product.
